# Getting Started with Space News

This website was created with react using the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and the News API. A NASA Apod picture is loaded and the description of the picture and title are shown next to it. Beneath the picture, relevant news articles about the picture will appear. Additionally, using the left and right arrows on next to the pictures allows you to scroll through additional NASA Apod pictures with relevant news displayed below.



# Git Hub Pages Website
The Git Hub pages website only displays the part of the website that uses the NASA apod api. Unfortuantely, the Git Hub pages website does not display the relevant news articles since I utilized a free version of the API that only allows API calls to be made when using a local host. I provide a screen recording of my website so you can see what it looks like with the news articles displayed below. Alternatively, you can download the repository and run npm start. 

## Available Scripts
